# Visual Ping

*Ping a host continuously and output a series of dots indicating the round-trip time. Write errors to a log file with time stamp. The log file defaults to Documents directory so the executable can be placed in system PATH and run without admin privileges.*

#### Example usage:

C:\Users\Username\Downloads>**pingg \<host\>**
